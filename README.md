# xen-setup

This role sets up a fully running Xen installation.
It automatically reboots the target and waits to come back if Xen was initially installed.
When anything else happens (i.e. change of the cmdline), Xen will not reboot to prevent service outages.

## Requirements

A recent Debian or Ubuntu installation with GRUB as the bootloader
